# APCSP Classwork

The coursework for the APCSP class is based on Harvard CS50. The course is mainly taught using C. The last lab and the final project use Python instead.

For my final project, I have created an interactive calculator that calculates BMI and the possibility of getting a brain stroke (please note that this is only a prediction using the data from previous patients) and gives suggestions based on the user's information.
