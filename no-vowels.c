No Vowel Lab

1. The user needs to type in 2 command-line arguments (the last one needs to be the word that will has its vowels replaced)
    if the user does not input 2 command-line arguments
        Message: "Please enter 2 command-line arguments\n"
        return 1 to indicate an error

2. Create a function to replace vowels of the word: needs the word as the input, will return the replaced word (string replace(string word))
    for every character in the string
        if the character is vowel
            replace that character with the corresponding number (except for u â€” it stays unchange)
    return the new replaced word

3. Create a variable to store the replaced word and call the the replace function and; input as the argv[2] (the input word in the command-line argument)

4. Print the replaced word
    Message "%s", replaced word
