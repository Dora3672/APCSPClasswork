This is day 10 assignment.

Prime numbers are defined as whole numbers greater than 1, whose only factors are 1 and itself.
So 3 is prime because its only factors are 1 and 3, while 4 is composite and not prime because it is the product of 2 Ã— 2.
In this lab, you will write an algorithm to generate all prime numbers in a range specified by the user.

Hints
Modulo may come in handy, as it produces the remainder when dividing two integers.
By definition, 1 is not a prime number.
There is only one even prime number, 2.



Prompt the user to enter the lower bound (get_int)
Use do...while loop to make sure the lower bound is not a negative number
Message: "Please enter the lower bound: "

Prompt the user to enter the upper bound (get_int)
Use do...while loop to make sure the upper bound is bigger than the lower bound
Message: "Please enter the upper bound: "

Check every number in the list to see if the number is divisible by any number that is smaller than it (except for 1)
(for loop to repeat the checking procedure for every number in the range; for loop to repeat the dividing process for all number smaller than the number that is currently being checked)
(if statement: if the number is 0 or 1, the number is not prime; if the number is 2, the number is prime; else, do the checking process mentioned above)

If the number is a prime number, the number is print out.

Print out the total number of prime numbers.
